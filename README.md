# DSA-Java – Practice & Problem Solving

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice in Java.  
It includes:

- Concept implementations (from Kunal Kushwaha's DSA Bootcamp and personal notes)
- A growing list of LeetCode problems categorized by DSA topic (Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc.)
- Problems are grouped by topic and further classified by difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Each solution is implemented in Java with clean code structure

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Concepts/` – Java programs based on DSA concepts like arrays, recursion, OOPs, etc.
- `LeetCode/` – LeetCode problem solutions organized by topic and difficulty

## 💻 Language
Java
